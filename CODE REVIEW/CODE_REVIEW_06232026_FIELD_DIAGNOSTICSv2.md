# Code Review — Field Client Diagnostics (MPPT Voltage, Current‑Loop Sensor, Config Delivery)

**Date:** 2026‑06‑23
**Author:** GitHub Copilot (AI review)
**Scope:** `TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta`, `TankAlarm-112025-Common` (solar/voltage/sensor paths),
`TankAlarm-112025-Server-BluesOpta` (config generator), `.github/workflows/release-firmware-112025.yml`
**Subject device:** `dev:860322068056545` — site **"Silas"**, sensor **"Cox Wellhead"** (gas, current‑loop), field/cellular
**Firmware context:** client OTA'd 1.9.42 → **2.0.41** successfully; **2.0.42** (observability) released and pending OTA.

---

## Executive summary

The OTA delivery pipeline is now healthy (see Issue 5 — resolved this session). Two field problems remain, and a
third (config delivery confirmation) is an open question rather than a confirmed bug:

| # | Issue | Most likely layer | Confidence | Blocking a firmware fix? |
|---|-------|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1 | No battery voltage on dashboard (MPPT) | **Config** (poller not enabled) → then wiring/driver | Medium‑high | No — verify config first |
| 2 | Current‑loop sensor reads `0` / `sensor-fault` | **Hardware** (A0602 I²C bus) | High | No — bench/HW issue (deferred "Fix 11") |
| 3 | Config "applied" confirmation not seen yet | Async delivery / client inbound sync | Open | No |
| 4 | RS‑485 driver review (watch items, no blocking bug) | Firmware (minor) | — | — |
| 5 | OTA slot image build regression | CI (**RESOLVED** 2.0.41 + guard 2.0.42) | Done | — |

**Key theme:** for both open field issues, the firmware logic is currently *correct* — it is reporting the
problem accurately (a reused/stale sensor value; no voltage because no source is configured/answering). The
work is to (a) confirm the device's **applied config**, (b) make the failure **observable remotely** (done in
2.0.42), and (c) only then chase wiring/driver details if needed.

## Issue 1 — No battery voltage reported (SunSaver MPPT / RS‑485)

### Symptom
Dashboard shows no VIN/battery voltage for the client. The 2.0.41 telemetry carries **no** `v`, `vs`,
`solar`, or `bv` fields; the only "voltage" anywhere in the Notehub event window is the Notecard's
`_health.qo` `voltage_mode:"usb"` (~4.6 V) — which on the Blues "Wireless for Opta" carrier is the **regulated
~5 V rail** and is *always* present regardless of field power. It is **not** a battery reading and is
deliberately excluded from the voltage logic.

### Code path (verified)
- `sendTelemetry()` — [client .ino ~L5951](../TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta/TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta.ino#L5951): adds `doc["v"] = getEffectiveBatteryVoltage()` **only if > 0** (so voltage is sent every cycle when a source exists, not daily‑only).
- `sendDailyReport()` — [client .ino ~L7636](../TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta/TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta.ino#L7636): same gate.
- `getEffectiveBatteryVoltage()` — [client .ino ~L7362](../TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta/TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta.ino#L7362): returns > 0 **only** from Source 1 (SunSaver MPPT: `gSolarManager.isEnabled() && isCommunicationOk()`) or Source 3 (Vin divider: `vinMonitor.enabled && gVinVoltage > 0.5`). Notecard Source 2 is compile‑gated out on Opta.
- Poller is started **only if** `gConfig.solarCharger.enabled` — [client .ino ~L1636](../TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta/TankAlarm-112025-Client-BluesOpta.ino#L1636).

### Root‑cause hypotheses (ranked)
1. **The client's *applied* config is still grid (poller never starts).** The cached config snapshot for this
   device (`client_config_cache.txt`, ~March 2026) reads `powerSource:"grid"`, `solarCharger:{enabled:false}`,
   `vinMonitor:{enabled:false}`. If that is still the live config, `getEffectiveBatteryVoltage()` correctly
   returns 0 and no code change helps. The operator selected "Solar + Modbus MPPT (RS‑485)" in the generator,
   but selection ≠ pushed‑and‑applied. **This is the cheapest thing to confirm and the most likely cause.**
2. **Config‑generator trap.** In the server generator
   ([server .ino ~L1999](../TankAlarm-112025-Server-BluesOpta/TankAlarm-112025-Server-BluesOpta.ino#L1999)):
   `solarCharger.enabled = (powerSource === 'solar_modbus_mppt')` **only**, while
   `mpptEnabled = powerSource.includes('mppt')`. So **"Solar + Non‑Monitored MPPT"** sets `mpptEnabled=true`
   but leaves `solarCharger.enabled=false` → the RS‑485 poller stays off. Only the **"Modbus MPPT (RS‑485)"**
   option actually enables it (and the generator requires a non‑"none" battery type).
3. **Config applied, but RS‑485 link silently failing.** If `solarCharger.enabled=true` but the SunSaver/MRC‑1
   doesn't answer, the result is *identical to "disabled" because the failure was silent (see Issue 4). 2.0.42
   makes this distinguishable via `scOk`.

### How to start exploring
1. **Verify applied config on the server** (you have it on the bench): load **Cox Wellhead** in the generator;
   confirm Power Source = "Solar + Modbus MPPT (RS‑485)" + a battery type; confirm a `config_ack` shows it
   **applied** (not merely selected). If it's still grid → **re‑push** — likely the whole fix.
2. **OTA v2.0.42**, then read telemetry: **no `scOk`** = not enabled in applied config; **`scOk:0`** = enabled
   but SunSaver not answering; **`scOk:1`** = link healthy.
3. If `scOk:0`: this is when (and only when) it becomes a wiring/driver hunt — see Issue 4.

### Status
Observability shipped in 2.0.42. Root cause pending the config verification + 2.0.42 OTA. **No driver change
made** (the code is sound; changing bench‑tuned timing on speculation is riskier than diagnosing first).

## Issue 2 — Current‑loop sensor reads `0` / recurring `sensor-fault` (A0602)

### Symptom / evidence (from the Notehub event log)
- Newest 2.0.41 telemetry: `{"st":"currentLoop","lvl":0,"ru":1,"pg":1, ... }` — i.e. **level 0, `ru:1`
  (reused/stale), no raw `ma` field**. The client could not obtain a fresh valid milliamp reading, so it
  reused the last value (0) and flagged it. `pg:1` shows the power‑gating transistor is enabled.
- Diagnostics: `diag.qo` `i2c-recovery` events (paired 1:1 with `sensor-fault`), all carrying **`fv:"1.9.42"`**
  (pre‑OTA). **2.0.41 raised no new `sensor-fault`** (count 0) — it reused instead.
- The `sensor-fault` alarm on the dashboard is therefore a **stale latch** from the 1.9.42 era, not a fresh fault.

### Root cause
The A0602 current‑loop module's **I²C bus is unreliable** — the recurring `i2c-recovery` + the inability to read
a valid `ma` is a **hardware/bus problem**, not a firmware logic bug. This is the previously‑deferred **"Fix 11"**
(see `CODE_REVIEW_06222026_DEFERRED_ITEMS.md`). v2.0.x changes made the dashboard report the condition
*accurately* (`ru:1`, no fabricated `0.0`) but cannot repair the physical bus.

### Two distinct sub‑problems
1. **The sensor itself isn't reading** (hardware) — needs bench investigation.
2. **The stale latched `sensor-fault` alarm** won't clear on its own while the sensor keeps faulting (and the
   client, reusing the value, isn't emitting a fresh fault/recovery transition). Server self‑clear logic exists
   for `sensor-stuck` ([server .ino ~L11787](../TankAlarm-112025-Server-BluesOpta/TankAlarm-112025-Server-BluesOpta.ino#L11787))
   but `sensor-fault` clears only on a client recovery note or manual clear.

### How to start exploring
1. **Hardware first (the real driver):** with the A0602 on the bench, run the validated probes already in the
   repo — `firmware/.../P1_Transistor_Gating_Test` and `Blueprint_CH0_Test` — and watch for the documented
   `~4.5 mA / ~1.6 PSI` healthy read. Check I²C wiring/pull‑ups, the P1 gating transistor, connector seating,
   and whether the A0602 NACKs under production I²C contention (Notecard + Modbus + sensor on the bus).
2. **Capture client serial** at a sample cycle (when bench‑accessible) for `"Failed to enable sensor power
   gating"` or current‑loop read errors.
3. **Alarm hygiene (optional firmware follow‑up):** consider clearing a latched `sensor-fault` on the server
   when fresh non‑fault telemetry arrives for that sensor (mirror the `sensor-stuck` self‑clear), so a recovered
   sensor doesn't keep a dead alarm lit. Only do this **after** the hardware read is restored, so we don't mask
   a genuine fault.

### Status
Deferred hardware issue (Fix 11). No firmware regression. Code is reporting it correctly.

## Issue 3 — Config "applied" confirmation not yet observed

### Observation
After pushing the Modbus‑MPPT config, no newer `config_ack.qo` from `dev:…545` was visible (last readable
events were the 9:14 PM OTA acks).

### Why this may be expected (not a bug)
Config delivery is **asynchronous**: server publishes → Notehub **queues** it for the client (via the
`ServerToClientRelay` route) → the client applies it on its **next inbound sync** → emits `config_ack.qo`. For a
field cellular client the inbound sync timing governs when the ack appears.

### What to verify
- **Server outbound** config note (`dev:…529`) confirms it was *sent*.
- **Client `config_ack.qo`** (`dev:…545`) confirms it was *applied* — this is the real confirmation.
- **Pending notes on the client device page:** if the config sits in *pending*, the client hasn't pulled it yet.

### Watch item (possible latent issue)
The **server** previously suffered a stale Notecard inbound‑sync condition (reported "connected" but didn't pull
queued notes — resolved by `sync:true` + periodic `hub.sync`, see build notes). If the **client** never acks
after a reasonable window, suspect the analogous client‑side inbound‑sync staleness, not the config content.

---

## Issue 4 — RS‑485 / SunSaver driver review (no blocking bug; watch items)

`TankAlarm_Solar.h` / `TankAlarm_Solar.cpp` are **mature** and already incorporate prior bench fixes:
`SERIAL_8N2`, `setTimeout` clamped ≥ 500 ms, `RS485.setDelays(0, 1200)` (post‑delay fix), bench‑verified live
ADC registers `0x0008–0x000C`, scaling `96.667 / 79.16`, FC03↔FC04 fallback with caching, plausibility clamps,
comm‑failure threshold. **No blocking defect found.** Watch items if Issue 1 resolves to `scOk:0`:

1. **`setDelays(0, 1200)` pre‑delay = 0.** Post‑delay was the documented fix; the **pre‑delay (DE‑assert →
   first byte) is 0**. For some transceivers/the MRC‑1 path this can clip the first byte. First knob to sweep —
   your `firmware/sunsaver-rs485-windowed-probe` already sweeps pre/post delays.
2. **`alertOnCommFailure` defaults `false`** (config generator doesn't set it). Combined with the (now‑fixed)
   silent daily omission, this is *why* the failure was invisible. Consider defaulting it **on** when
   `solarCharger.enabled` (or surface comm state on the dashboard) so field links self‑report.
3. **Silent‑failure gap — partially fixed in 2.0.42.** `sendTelemetry` now emits `scOk`, and
   `appendSolarDataToDaily` now emits `{commOk:0,errs:N}` on failure instead of omitting the block. Remaining
   follow‑up: have the **server** parse/display `scOk`/`commOk` on the dashboard (currently visible only in raw
   note bodies / event log).
4. **No raw‑frame diagnostic.** If we reach a true link hunt, add a one‑shot client diagnostic that dumps the
   exact Modbus request bytes and any response (or timeout) for `SS_REG_BATTERY_VOLTAGE`, so we can see what the
   SunSaver returns without a site visit.

## Issue 5 — OTA slot‑image build regression (RESOLVED this session, for context)

Documented here so the timeline is complete:
- **Bug:** commit `2926b11` (a "release notes" commit) silently reverted the client OTA build from the core
  `security=sien` path back to a plain build + external imgtool + custom keys. The resulting `.slot.bin` was
  linked for the wrong address (`0x08040000` vs the MCUboot slot `0xA0000000`) and signed with keys the Opta
  bootloader doesn't trust → MCUboot reverted every trial boot ("trial boot reverted by MCUboot").
- **Fix:** restored the `security=sien` build step (v2.0.41), re‑released as 2.0.41 (2.0.40 got blacklisted
  on‑device after the revert).
- **Guard:** v2.0.42 CI adds a **"Validate client OTA slot image (MCUboot magic)"** step that fails the release
  if the slot `.bin` doesn't start with `3d b8 f3 96` (MCUboot `IMAGE_MAGIC`). A plain build starts with the
  STM32 vector table (`00 00 08 24`).
- **Prevention (process):** `git pull --rebase` before editing/committing; one logical change per commit; review
  the full diff (including files you didn't mean to touch); consider not committing `build/*.bin` + the Common
  `.zip` (stale‑copy surface); branch protection + PR review on master. The root mechanism was a **stale
  single‑file copy** committed on a linear history (no merge conflict to flag it).

---

## Prioritized exploration plan (start here)

1. **Confirm the client's *applied* config** on the server (Cox Wellhead → Power Source = Solar + Modbus MPPT
   (RS‑485) + AGM). If still grid → **re‑push**. *(Cheapest; likely resolves Issue 1.)*
2. **Confirm the config ack** (`config_ack.qo` from `dev:…545`). If none after a reasonable window → suspect
   client inbound‑sync staleness (Issue 3 watch item), not the config.
3. **OTA v2.0.42** and read `scOk` in telemetry to classify Issue 1 precisely: not‑enabled / not‑answering /
   healthy.
4. If `scOk:0` → RS‑485 link hunt (Issue 4): sweep pre‑delay, verify MRC‑1 power + A/B polarity + slave ID/baud,
   add the raw‑frame diagnostic.
5. **Issue 2 (sensor) is a parallel hardware track** — run the A0602 bench probes; it does not block the voltage
   work and is not a firmware bug.

## Architectural Thoughts and Recommendations

### 1. Solar MPPT / RS-485 Communication Robustness
* **Issue Detection vs. Silence:** Currently, if the battery voltage reads `0` on the dashboard because `solarCharger.enabled = false` in the applied configuration, there is no visual alert indicating that the solar monitoring pipeline has been bypass-disabled. We highly recommend adding a dedicated "Solar State: Disabled" / "Solar State: Enabled-Ok/Enabled-Failing" status badge to the main server dashboard using `scOk` values introduced in v2.0.42 telemetry.
* **Timing & Transient Safety:** Standard Modbus character timing requires specific inter-frame spacers. Morningstar MRC-1 transceivers are internally opto-isolated and draw power directly from the SunSaver MeterBus RJ-11 port. The existing `RS485.setDelays(0, 1200)` handles post-TX character spacing cleanly. However, in cellular environments with intense RF-induced noise on the board power rails, adding a tiny, hardware-based Modbus retry logic within the client's loop (e.g., retrying three consecutive read attempts spaced by 100ms on a NACK/timeout before raising `SOLAR_ALERT_COMM_FAILURE` or setting `communicationOk = false`) is highly recommended.

### 2. A0602 I2C / Current-Loop Bus Staleness Safeguards
* **Telemetry and Daily Report Divergence:** The client's `readCurrentLoopSensor()` functions are designed to reuse the last valid sample (resulting in `ru: 1`) on read failures to avoid sudden dashboard flatlines. However, this safety guard currently introduces a reporting gap: when every single acquisition sample fails, `currentSensorMa` is not updated under `validSamples == 0`, meaning daily logs can continuously ship a completely stale, frozen, or incorrect `ma` value.
* **Recommendations:**
  * **Explicit Latching for Daily Reports:** Ensure that if `validSamples == 0` persists consecutively through multiple sample intervals, the client forcibly logs raw mA as `0.0f` (or NaN) during daily report assemblies to guarantee the outage is visible in the physical logs rather than outputting a frozen, historically deceptive sample value.
  * **Server-Side Latching Health Sanitization:** Since server-side `sensor-stuck` alarms are cleared when new telemetry arrives, we should align the `sensor-fault` alarms with the same behavior: clear `sensor-fault` states on the server dashboard only when fresh *non-reused* (`ru: 0`) and valid telemetry is verified. This ensures transient physical recoveries clear alarms naturally while preserving stable latched fault displays during absolute failures.

### 3. Asynchronous Config Pipeline Synchronization
* **Inbound Sync Staleness Safeguards:** The asynchronous nature of cellular config-push routes can mask local on-device sleep/wake sync traps. Since we rely on `config_ack.qo` to confirm that the client successfully applied a pushed RS-485 policy, it is recommended to expose the client's last configuration timestamp alongside the "applied" versus "pending" states directly in the Server management view. This makes it instantly obvious to operators if a device on-site is failing to pull its latest queued configuration.
